Brandshare Video is a video creation tool that allows users to create videos for social media in a matter of minutes. The tool is built on top of the Brandshare platform, which is a content management system for brands to manage their social media content.

With video production being a time-consuming and expensive process, Brandshare video allows users to create videos in a matter of minutes through intuitive inputs. The tool allows users to upload their own video or select from a library of pre-made videos. Users can then add their own text, images, and music to the video. The tool also allows users to add their own branding to the video, such as their logo and colors.
