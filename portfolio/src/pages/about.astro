					Hello, I'm Manuel, a software developer who is passionate
					about creating innovative and user-friendly digital
					products. I specialize in developing products that not only
					function seamlessly but are also visually appealing. My
					experience and knowledge in both software development and
					creative production enable me to create products that are
					customized to my clients' specific needs. <br />
					<br />
					I am committed to pushing the limits of digital product development
					by staying updated with the latest technologies and techniques.
					When I'm not working, you can find me exploring my passion for
					3D design and motion graphics. Whether it's working with Blender
					or Adobe After Effects, I am always looking for ways to create
					functional and aesthetically pleasing digital products. <br
					/>
					<br />
					If you have an exciting idea for an AI, AR, or 3D project, I'd
					love to hear about it! I'm always up for a challenge and am eager
					to collaborate with people who share my passion.
