Dell asked Synthesia to create a video to showcase some of it's sustainability initiatives by different Dell representatives. The video was created in collaboration with Dell's marketing team and was used to promote Dell's sustainability initiatives.

The videos also needed to be localized for different regions, so we created a template that could be easily localized for different regions. Processes were also put in place to make sure that the videos were localized in a timely manner.

Resulting in 30+ videos that were localized for different regions.
